✋ AirInk — Gesture-Based Drawing System

AirInk is a real-time gesture-controlled drawing application that allows users to draw on screen using hand and finger movements detected through a webcam.

Instead of touching the screen, users can write or sketch naturally in the air using Computer Vision and AI-powered hand tracking.

---

🚀 Live Concept

«Draw without touching. Write in the air.»

AirInk transforms your webcam into a touchless digital canvas, enabling natural human–computer interaction using hand gestures.

---

🧠 Project Overview

AirInk uses AI hand tracking to detect finger movements and converts them into drawing strokes on a digital canvas.

The system continuously tracks hand landmarks and maps the index finger position to screen coordinates for real-time drawing.
